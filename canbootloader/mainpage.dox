/** \mainpage CAN bootloader for AVR devices.
\section intro_sec Introduction
	I had a hard time finding a simple and well documented CAN based bootloader of AVR processors so I decided to implement
	one myself. As of now, the bootloader supports basic functions such as reading and writing flash and eeprom. It also 
	has the possibility of rebooting the module and starting the main application. The documentation should be pretty good
	and simple to understand. I have done my best to keep things simple and readable. 
	The latest version of the code is always available at http://proximia.fi
